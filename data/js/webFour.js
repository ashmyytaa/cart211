iptions to be shared among up to six (6) members of a Family. To learn more about Family Sharing visit: https://support.apple.com/HT201060. Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows eligible Content to be shared among up to si
x (6) members of a Family. The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer’s eligible payment methods are used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family membe
r (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s eligible payment methods are used. The Organizer hereby agrees: (1) to pay for such Tr
ansactions; (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized; and (3) Transactions will be charged to eligible payment methods in the manner indicated in Section B above. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment meth
od contracts, and assume all risk related to sharing access to their eligible payment methods with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and, if billed to the Organizer’s payment
method, also to the Organizer. Ask to Buy: Ask to Buy is a feature that allows an Organizer to approve Transactions initiated by a Family member under age eighteen (18) (or the equivalent age of majority in their Home Country). Content shared by Famil
y members or acquired via content codes generally is not subject to Ask to Buy; content codes facilitating access to Subscriptions are subject to Ask to Buy. The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy i
s activated. Ask to Buy is enabled by default for any Family member under the age of thirteen (13) (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country) and stays on until deactivated by the parent or legal guardian. If Ask to Buy is turned off aftert
he Family member turns eighteen (18) years old (or reaches the age of majority in their Home Country), it cannot be turned on anymore. Ask to Buy does not require Purchase Sharing to be enabled.Family Member changes: When a Family member leaves or isr
emoved from the Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the former member’s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer’s payment method.Family Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one (1) Family at a time, and
may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple Account you associate with a Family no more than once every ninety (90) days. All Family members must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purchases, S
ubscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for Purchase Sharing. Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.N. SEASON PASS AND MULTI-PASS. A Pass allows you to purchase a
nd receive television Content as it becomes available. A Season Pass applies to television Content that has a limited number of episodes per season; a Multi-Pass applies to television Content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of aS
eason Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the Transaction. Season Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to ninety (90) days after the last episode becomes available. If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodest
han planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Apple Account the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple. O. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING APPLE ARCADE APPS). LICENSE OF APP ST
ORE CONTENT. App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”). Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in operating the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the AppP
rovider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd. or Apple Services Pte. Ltd., then the merchant of record is that entity, which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd. or AppleS
ervices Pte. Ltd., as applicable, but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application EndU
ser License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”). Subject to local law, the App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its cont
ent and warranties, as well as any claims that you may have related to the Third Party App. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enfo
rce such agreement. Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer. IN-APP PURCHASES. Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use withins
uch Apps (“In-App Purchases”). In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purcha
ses – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID. You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen (15) minutes without re-authenticating unless you have asked us t
o require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT201304. APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT. Apple is responsible f
or providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law. App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps. APP BUNDLES. Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bund
le”). The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to completet
he App Bundle. SEARCH RESULTS AND RANKINGS. When determining how to order the Apps in search results, the main parameters considered are the metadata provided by App Providers, how customers have engaged with the Apps and the App Store, and the popula
rity of the Apps in the App Store. These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT. Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your licen

ent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application). b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—includin
g but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related t
o the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you. c. Termination. This Standard EULA is effective unt
il terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.d. External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party servicesa

uaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use
the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriateo
r available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose acces
s restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you. e. NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICA
BLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS
WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFEC
TIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS

OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTION
S DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may ber
equired by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.`;
